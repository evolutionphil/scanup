# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
##     file: "file_path.py"
##     stuck_count: 0
##     priority: "high"  # or "medium" or "low"
##     needs_retesting: false

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

    message: "LOCAL-FIRST STORAGE IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE:
    
    This implementation provides instant document saving with background cloud sync:
    
    1. ✅ documentStore.ts - Completed local-first architecture:
       - createDocumentLocalFirst() - Saves documents instantly to local state/AsyncStorage
       - syncQueue management - Tracks documents pending upload
       - syncPendingDocuments() - Background sync to S3 when online
       - Network listener integration - Auto-syncs when network becomes available
       
    2. ✅ scanner.tsx - Updated to use local-first approach:
       - Both guests and logged-in users now get instant document saves
       - No network latency on save - document appears immediately
       - Background sync happens automatically for logged-in users
       
    3. ✅ DocumentCard.tsx - Added sync status indicator:
       - Shows cloud upload icon when document is pending sync
       - Shows spinner when actively syncing
       - Shows error icon if sync failed
       
    4. ✅ Home screen (index.tsx) - Added sync features:
       - Network listener that triggers sync on reconnect
       - Sync status banner showing 'Syncing...' or 'X documents waiting to sync'
       - Loads from local cache first for instant display
       
    User Experience Improvement:
    - Before: User taps save → waits 2-5 seconds for upload → sees success
    - After: User taps save → instant success → sync happens in background
    
    Please test:
    - Scan and save a document (should be instant)
    - Check home screen for sync indicator
    - Turn off network and save → turn on network → verify sync happens"

    message: "BUG FIXES AND FEATURE ADDITIONS COMPLETE:
    
    1. ✅ BUG FIX - 'Initial Document' title:
       - Fixed in index.tsx: DocumentListItem was using 'document.title' instead of 'document.name'
       - Grid view (DocumentCard) already used correct 'document.name' field
       - List view now also uses 'document.name' correctly
       
    2. ✅ FEATURE - Signature Editing:
       - Modified document/[id].tsx: Sign button now shows 'Re-Sign' when page has existing edits
       - When re-signing, user gets three options:
         a) Cancel - do nothing
         b) Add New - add another signature on top
         c) Start Fresh - revert to original, then add new signature
       - Revert button remains for undoing all signature edits
       
    3. ✅ IMPROVED - Google Login:
       - Added detailed logging to diagnose auth flow issues
       - Fixed redirect URL for web (uses window.location.origin instead of BACKEND_URL)
       - Added better user feedback for cancelled/dismissed logins
       - Backend implementation was already correct (Emergent Auth integration)
       
    Note: Google Login should work on the Expo Go app - you can test by:
    1. Tap 'Continue with Google' button
    2. Complete Google sign-in in the browser that opens
    3. You should be redirected back to the app with session_id
    4. Console logs will show the auth flow for debugging
    
    If it still redirects to email/password screen, check the console logs
    for the exact point where the flow fails."

    message: "BOOK SCAN MODE & SCANNING ANIMATION IMPROVEMENTS COMPLETE:
    
    ## Phase 1: Scanning Animation Fix ✅
    - Animation now stays INSIDE the document alignment frame
    - Positioned relative to frame bounds, not screen bounds
    - Smooth scan line animation from top to bottom of frame only
    
    ## Phase 2: Book Scan Mode Enhancements ✅
    
    ### Frontend Changes (scanner.tsx):
    - Updated Book mode frame to landscape aspect ratio (1.6)
    - Enhanced DocumentGuide with clear two-page layout:
      - Prominent center gutter line (dashed vertical)
      - Separate boxes for Left Page and Right Page
      - Page number labels (1 and 2)
      - Top labels showing 'Left Page' and 'Right Page'
    - Modified crop hint for book mode: 'Pages will be split automatically'
    - Modified crop button: 'Split & Save Pages' with layers icon
    - Updated handleApplyCrop to use new split-book-pages endpoint
    - Book captures now automatically create 2 separate pages in preview
    
    ### Backend Changes (server.py):
    New endpoint: POST /api/images/split-book-pages
    
    Features:
    1. **Automatic Gutter Detection**:
       - Uses vertical line detection (Hough transform)
       - Falls back to brightness analysis (shadows in gutter)
       - Returns detected gutter position for transparency
       
    2. **Automatic Page Splitting**:
       - Splits at detected/provided gutter position
       - Adds 1% overlap to prevent content loss
       
    3. **Independent Perspective Correction**:
       - Each page gets its own correction
       - Detects document edges with contour analysis
       - Applies 4-point perspective transform
       - Handles keystoning automatically
    
    ## How to Test Book Scan:
    1. Open scanner
    2. Select 'Book' mode
    3. Align open book within the frame (notice the split UI)
    4. Capture photo
    5. Adjust crop points on crop screen
    6. Tap 'Split & Save Pages'
    7. Two separate pages appear in preview (Page 1, Page 2)
    8. Continue scanning more pages or save document
    
    ## Technical Notes:
    - Perspective correction uses OpenCV contour detection + warpPerspective
    - Works without requiring manual gutter adjustment
    - Each page is independently corrected for best results"

    message: "DOCUMENT ANNOTATIONS FEATURE IMPLEMENTED:
    
    ## Frontend Changes:
    1. ✅ AnnotationEditor component already existed with full functionality:
       - Drawing tools: freehand, text, arrow, rectangle, circle, highlight
       - Color picker with 7 preset colors
       - Stroke width controls (2, 4, 6, 8px)
       - Undo and clear functionality
       - SVG-based rendering on canvas
       
    2. ✅ Document screen (document/[id].tsx) updated:
       - Added 'Annotate' button with brush icon to action bar
       - Integrated AnnotationEditor modal
       - Handler to save annotations via backend API
       - Stores original image before annotating for revert capability
       
    ## Backend Changes:
    1. ✅ New endpoint: POST /api/images/apply-annotations
       - Accepts image and array of annotation objects
       - Uses Pillow to render annotations onto image
       - Supports: freehand paths, text, arrows, rectangles, circles, highlights
       - Returns annotated image as base64
       
    ## How to Test:
    1. Open any scanned document
    2. Tap 'Annotate' button in action bar
    3. Select a tool (Draw, Text, Arrow, Rectangle, Circle, Highlight)
    4. Draw on the document
    5. Tap 'Done' to save annotations
    6. Use 'Revert' button to undo all annotations if needed"

    message: "WHITE SCREEN BUG FIX - Guest Mode Navigation:
    
    ## Problem Analysis:
    The white screen crash in guest mode was caused by navigation issues when:
    1. Scanner uses `router.replace()` which corrupts the navigation stack
    2. `router.back()` called when there's nothing to go back to
    3. Double navigation attempts causing race conditions
    
    ## Fixes Applied:
    
    ### 1. document/[id].tsx:
    - Added `isMountedRef` to track component mount state
    - Added `isNavigatingRef` to prevent double navigation
    - Changed `handleGoBack()` to always use `router.replace('/(tabs)')` for consistency
    - Added navigation lock on 'Add Page' button to prevent race conditions
    - Wrapped all navigation in try-catch with fallbacks
    
    ### 2. scanner.tsx:
    - Added `isNavigatingRef` to prevent double navigation
    - Improved `handleGoBack()` to handle both new scans and 'Add Page' scenarios
    - When adding pages to existing document, now uses `router.replace()` after success
    - All navigation wrapped in try-catch with proper fallbacks
    
    ## Key Changes:
    - Navigation is now more deterministic (always replace to known route)
    - Double-tap protection prevents white screen from concurrent navigations
    - Mount state tracking prevents state updates on unmounted components
    
    ## How to Test:
    1. Continue as Guest
    2. Scan a new document
    3. On document screen, tap Back button → should go to home
    4. Open document again, tap 'Add Page'
    5. Scan or cancel → should return to document or home
    6. Both actions should not cause white screen"

    ### Action Sheet Modal Implementation Verification:
    📋 **CODE REVIEW CONFIRMS ALL REQUIREMENTS MET:**
    
    ✅ **Custom Bottom Sheet Design**: Modal uses custom React Native Modal with slide animation (NOT native iOS action sheet)
    
    ✅ **Header Layout Verified**:
    - Document name positioned on TOP LEFT (fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 700, textAlign: left)
    - Subtitle with page count and 'PDF' below document name (fontSize: 14, color: rgb(107, 114, 128))
    - Close X button positioned on TOP RIGHT (Ionicons.close, size: 24)
    
    ✅ **Menu Options All Present**:
    - Name (with pencil-outline icon)
    - Edit (with create-outline icon) 
    - Print (with print-outline icon - same styling as other options)
    - Password (with lock-closed-outline icon)
    - Move to Folder (with folder-outline icon)
    - Delete (with trash-outline icon, styled in RED: color: #EF4444)
    
    ✅ **No Cancel Button**: Correctly replaced by X close button in header
    
    ✅ **Modal Structure**: 
    - Overlay with rgba(0,0,0,0.4) background
    - Bottom sheet with rounded top corners (borderTopLeftRadius: 20, borderTopRightRadius: 20)
    - Proper touch handling with stopPropagation
    
    ### Testing Limitations:
    📭 No existing documents found for live interaction testing (expected for new app)
    🔐 Document creation requires authentication (401 errors for unauthenticated requests)
    
    ### Conclusion:
    The document action sheet modal is **FULLY IMPLEMENTED** and meets all specified requirements. The modal code is present in `/app/frontend/app/(tabs)/index.tsx` lines 1059-1111 with correct styling, layout, and functionality. Testing was limited by lack of existing documents, but code review confirms complete implementation."
